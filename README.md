# Python-challenge
Module 3 Challenge: Using the  Python scripting concepts learned to complete 2 Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll.
In the first half of the assignment named: PyBank, the analysis results needed to include:
  Title: "Financial Analysis"
  The total number of months included in the dataset
  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period AND the average of those changes
  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
The grand finale was the data populating in the Terminal AND output as a .txt file to the Analysis folder associated with PyBank.

The Second half of the assignment is named: PyPoll,. The analysis results includes:
  Title: "Election Results"
  Total number of votes cast
  Complete list of candidates who received votes
  Percentage of votes each candidate wone
  The total number of votes each candidate won
  The winner of the election based on popular vote
And like the previous half: The data populating the Terminal AND output as a .txt fil to the Analysis folder associated with PyPoll.

In order to complete the Challenge recently learned skills in Python and previously learned skills for coding were used such as:
Importing the os and csv
creating a pahtway for the CSV to be opened and read
initializing a.k.a. creating variables
Using the 'for' and 'if'
printing to ensure results are populating correctly
output /file.write

After today, if I have learned nothing at all, I can say, I learned how much this can cause a headache if you are not careful in how the syntax is written. It can take hours to debug your code, but learning to read the error messesages and realizing the message gave a clear focus as to what line the issue is has helped greatly. What helped me along the way was the resources provided by Gulsevi, youtube, and a few coworkers who did not mind pointing me in the right direction if I veered off a bit. 

Please enjoy my blood, sweat, and tears....cause this took quite a bit of sacrifice.
